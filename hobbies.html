                <p>Gaming is a passion of mine. I enjoy playing various genres, with a particular interest in first-person shooters like <a href="https://playoverwatch.com" target="_blank">Overwatch</a> and <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-sg/">Valorant</a>. I love the strategy and teamwork involved in these games, as well as the bonding and fun I can have with my friends.</p>

                    <p>Swimming is my go-to activity for relaxation and fitness. It keeps me healthy and energized. I enjoy swimming in both pools and natural bodies of water.</p>
